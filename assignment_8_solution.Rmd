# Q1.A pipe manufacturing organization produces different kinds of pipes. 
# We are given the monthly data of the wall thickness of certain types of pipes 
# (data is available on LMS Clt-data.csv).
# The organization has an analysis to perform and one of the basic assumption 
# of that analysis is that the data should be normally distributed.
# You have the following tasks to do:
# (a) Import the csv data file in R.
# (b) Validate data for correctness by counting number of rows and viewing the 
# xtop ten rows of the dataset.
# (c) Calculate the population mean and plot the observations by making a histogram.
# (d) Mark the mean computed in last step by using the function abline.
data = read.csv("Clt-data.csv")

# Q2.The following table gives information on ages and cholesterol levels for a

# Q3.A research methodology course has recently been added to the PhD curriculum 
# at the Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala. To evaluate 
# its effec- tiveness, students take a test on formulating research problems and
# writing research papers both before and after completing the course. Assume 
# that the differences between the pre-course and post-course test scores are 
# normally distributed, and a high score on the test indicates a strong level of 
# assertive- ness. Do the collected data, at 5% level of significance, provide 
# enough evidence to conclude that research scholars become more assertive after
# completing the course?
